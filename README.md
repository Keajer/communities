communities
===========

Network analysis of scientific community structures

master: do not commit to master; a working code from the main 
development branch has to go through a review first
before release to the master

maindev: main development branch - here we merge our code 
development to create a working code

feature branches: create a branch for each feature or bug fix; these 
branches can be made visible to other team members via git hub; when 
merging a feature branch to the maindev branch make sure that the 
resulting code is working
