to automatically deduce the pathname of output directories'

START_YEAR= 'The start year of the data set to be sliced, e.g. 1991.'

END_YEAR= 'The end year of the data set to be sliced, e.g. 2010.'

TYPE= 'The type of time slicing. Possible values are

INPUT_PATH= 'The relative path from the root directory of the github 
repository, i.e. 'communities' to the actual data file which is typically

in ProjectRoot/Data/FieldX/DataY/reduced/reducedData.txt.'

OUTPUT_PATH= 'The relative path from the root directory of the github
repository, i.e. 'communities' to the runs subdirectory within the
